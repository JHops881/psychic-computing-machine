## About
This is an ongoing project written in C++ with the aim of deeply learning about game development by diving into it. The vision for the project is a 2D top-down survival game. The graphics API that we are using is OpenGL with the GLFW framework. 
## Features
As the game is in its extremely early stages, and we are still learning, the application only features a single triangle drawn on GLFW window using OpenGL.
